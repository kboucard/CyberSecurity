//Cybersecurity Statement

Tech has always been something I thought I would never be able to venture in. Now that I know it is possible, my eagerness to learn new things and stay engaged all the time will help positively impact an organizationâ€™s standing. I have many experiences in being detailed-oriented, adapting to changes, and managing my time wisely. I value following procedures, protecting private information, and finding accurate solutions to problems. I want to be able to develop my programming skills further.//
